# chatbot

- We have built our chatbot's brain by predefining rule based agents/responses. 
Since one of the key feature of our bot is no usage of external API's.
We are not calling any 3rd party Restful API taking consideration into 
the fact of user data security.

- Bot has been designed in a way that it will follow up the user with further intents.
We need to feed the required intent/info into it so that it would understand and reciprocate.
Point to note here is that, if the user provides all the intents all at a time, then bot will not
ask for further intent and answers given.
 
- The features of this Bot can be scaled to recognize human or human like voice and reciprocate 
in a human understandable machine voice.

- There is one more feature which has been integrated.Sometimes it is imperative to go through the previous
chat history for financial reference. User can export the his/her chat history.
